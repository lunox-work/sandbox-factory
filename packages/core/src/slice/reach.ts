/**
 * The bounded walk that proposes a slice.
 *
 * Starting from the entry points, files are reached over the dependency
 * relations graphify records, breadth first, until the budget is spent:
 * `maxDepth` edges from the nearest entry point, `maxFiles` files in all.
 * Everything reached inside the budget is _included_; every dependency
 * edge that leaves the included set is a _cut_, outbound where the slice
 * needs something outside and inbound where outside code needs the slice.
 *
 * Pure and deterministic: nodes are visited in path order within a level,
 * so the same graph, entry points and budget give the same slice however
 * the graph file ordered its arrays. The budget bounds the proposal; it
 * does not prove the slice closed. Imports the compiler could not resolve
 * and dynamic imports are reported as dependencies for the caller to turn
 * into blockers, never dropped.
