/**
 * Workspace vocabulary: the names that say whose code a sandbox was cut
 * from (the organization, its repository, its package scope, its author)
 * and the check that none of them reaches a public file.
 *
 * Pseudonyms are what hide those names, but a table can be empty or miss
 * one, and a sliced version is the workspace's own code. So a build scans
 * what contributors would read, paths and text, for every name the
 * workspace goes by, and a name still there blocks the build until the
 * table renames it.
 *
 * A name is matched by its words, whatever joins them: `sandbox-factory`
 * is found as `sandboxFactory`, `SANDBOX_FACTORY` and `sandbox factory`.
 * A match must start and end on a word boundary, where a case change in an
 * identifier counts as one: `acme` is found in `acmeOrders`, `MyAcme` and
 * `ACMEOrders`, not in `acmes`. A name too short or too generic to say
 * whose code it is (`api`, `web`, `monorepo`) is not scanned for.
 *
 * An organization's names are scanned word by word as well: `Acme Corp`
 * writes its packages `@acme/ledger` and its code `acmeOrders`, never
 * `acme-corp`. Only its distinctive words, though: one of at least
 * `VOCABULARY_TERM_MIN` letters that is not a legal form or trade
 * (`ORGANIZATION_WORDS`) nor an everyday word (`COMMON_WORDS`), whatever its
 * length. `First Choice Logistics` is scanned whole, never as `first`, or
 * every `firstName` would block; `acme` and `payflow` are scanned alone.
 * Other names (a repository's, a package's) are matched only whole, since
 * `billing-service` names one product but `billing` is everyone's word. A
 * name or word without a letter (`12345`) names nothing and is dropped.
