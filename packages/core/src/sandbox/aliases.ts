/**
 * Alias rules: the private, bidirectional name table a sandbox version
 * applies to copied source before it can leave the organization.
 *
 * A rule is an explicit pair with a kind and a scope. Rules are ordered,
 * and applied in that order; they are validated as a set before any text
 * is touched, because two rules that look harmless alone can interact (one
 * rule's output is another's input, two rules share a target, two names
 * differ only by case). Application is deterministic and textual, bounded
 * to identifier or path tokens so a name inside a longer identifier is
 * never touched, and it is checked to be reversible: applying the inverse
 * table to the output must give the input back byte for byte. A
 * transformation that cannot be mapped back is refused, never silently
 * dropped. Redaction of implementation is not a rename and has no place
 * here.
