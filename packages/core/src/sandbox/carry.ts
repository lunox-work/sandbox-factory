/**
 * Carrying a change between a version's public names and the repository's:
 * the reverse path merge-back needs (a submission, made in public names,
 * as a patch on the repository at the pinned commit), and the forward path
 * the CI judge needs (a pull request's files, in the repository's names,
 * as a submission on the version).
 *
 * The build's transforms are token-for-token and never add or remove a
 * line: the name table, import specifiers rewritten to the slice's layout,
 * mocked packages and environment variables renamed. So a version's file
 * and the repository's line up line by line, and a change carries by line:
 *
 * - A line the change kept is the other side's line at the same place,
 *   byte for byte. A change that touches nothing carries to the original.
 * - A line the change added is renamed token by token, first by what the
 *   two originals' differing lines show the build renamed in this file
 *   (an import specifier, a package, an environment variable), then by the
 *   name table. It is refused unless renaming it back gives it again, so
 *   new text holding a name the side it was written on never shows (the
 *   repository's own names, in a contribution) cannot pass through.
 * - A line the change added that imports the sandbox's harness (a mock, a
 *   stub), which the repository does not have, is refused.
 *
 * Pure and platform-neutral: the worker reads the files, the API writes
 * the pull request.
